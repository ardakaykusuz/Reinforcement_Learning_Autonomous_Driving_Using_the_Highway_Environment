# Reinforcement_Learning_Autonomous_Driving_Using_the_Highway_Environment
The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) agents for autonomous driving using the highway environment simulation. We focused on three RL algorithms: DQN, SAC, and A2C, each tested with various observation types and action spaces. Through a systematic grid search and rigorous hyperparameter tuning, we identified the optimal configurations for each model. Custom reward functions were also explored to enhance performance. Our findings indicate that while DQN learned much faster and demonstrated good performance, A2C achieved similar results with the same observations and actions. Meanwhile, SAC, although slower in learning compared to A2C and DQN, performed competitively in terms of rewards. In summary, this work underscores the potential of RL in advancing autonomous driving technology by showcasing the strengths and limitations of different RL algorithms in this context.
